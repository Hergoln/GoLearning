# Look at me, I'm a Gopher now!
Within this repository you will not find anything particularily usefull as this is just a documentation of my tries to understand Go specifics and concepts used within the specification. As well as build projects from my university lectures using Go.

### Subjects/projects that I build in here:
* GoTour: my walkthrough of [Go Tour from go.dev portal](https://go.dev/tour)

* PS (short for *Programowanie Sieciowe (eng Network Programming)*): one of subjects at my university, it was a lot of fun as it was subject on networking and a lot of Go basics resolve around netowrking (I think). Inside are laboratory pdfs with instructions (only in polish :poland:) and directories with my implementations.

* PSI (short for *Podstawy Sztucznej Inteligencji (eng Basics of Artificial Inteligence)*): another of subjects at my university, this time on basics of Machine Learning. There are no instructions for each laboratory specificaly, however the goal was to implement set of functions and structures that will create, train and enable to use Deep Convoluted Neural Networks.
